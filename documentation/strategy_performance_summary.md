## Comparison with Optimization Results

### ML Strategy
| Metric | Optimization Results | Out-of-Sample Test |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Win Rate | 75.00% | 44.59% |
| Annual Return | 37.48% | 3.81% |
| Max Drawdown | 10.69% | 16.64% |
| Profit Factor | 2.19 | 1.33 |
| Sharpe Ratio | 3.00 | 0.31 |

### Medallion Strategy
| Metric | Optimization Results | Out-of-Sample Test |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Win Rate | 47.29% | 62.16% |
| Annual Return | 18.77% | 17.16% |
| Max Drawdown | 18.88% | 21.15% |
| Profit Factor | 1.16 | 2.40 |
| Sharpe Ratio | 1.45 | 1.28 |

## Key Findings

1. **ML Strategy Performance Gap**: The ML strategy showed significant performance degradation in out-of-sample testing compared to optimization results. This suggests potential overfitting during the optimization process.

2. **Medallion Strategy Robustness**: The Medallion strategy demonstrated remarkable consistency between optimization and out-of-sample testing, with some metrics (win rate, profit factor) actually improving in the test period.

3. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The Medallion strategy achieved a much higher Sharpe ratio (1.28 vs 0.31), indicating better risk-adjusted returns.

4. **Drawdown Management**: Both strategies experienced higher drawdowns in the test period than during optimization, with the ML strategy showing a more significant relative increase.

## Recommendations

1. **Prefer Medallion Strategy for Live Trading**: Based on the test results, the Medallion strategy appears more robust and reliable for real-world trading conditions.

2. **Re-optimize ML Strategy**: Consider re-optimizing the ML strategy with more emphasis on preventing overfitting, such as using cross-validation or walk-forward optimization.

3. **Combine Strategies**: Explore the possibility of a combined approach that leverages the strengths of both strategies, potentially using the ML model as a filter for Medallion strategy signals.

4. **Extended Testing**: Conduct further testing across different market conditions and timeframes to ensure strategy robustness.

5. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform sensitivity analysis on the Medallion strategy parameters to understand which parameters have the most impact on performance.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Medallion strategy in a live trading environment with careful risk management.
2. Continue monitoring performance and compare with backtest results.
3. Develop a framework for regular strategy re-optimization based on recent market data.
4. Explore additional features and improvements for the ML strategy to address overfitting issues.
